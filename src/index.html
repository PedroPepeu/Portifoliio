            <h2>About me</h2>
            As I said, my name is Pedro. I`m an computer science graduate at UNICAP, I live in Brazil, 
            I started my gradutation in 2022 as soon as I could after I finished school. The only previous 
            knoledge I had about programming was a video that I saw to do an discord bot, and that is where 
            we begin.

            <div class="text-tdb">
                The discord bot I did using the replit, it was first IDE that I used in a moment where I did not even
                know about what was an IDE. I used Python to do it, his name is James Von James, after this, I did the 
                Austin Humble the Thrid Junior, and his sucessor and the last one, Kraken, even if he has the worse name 
                from all three, he was the better one, and did his music funcionalities pretty good!

            an event that is hosted by the City Hall and some enterprises from Porto Digital, to embrace inovations and 
            improvements to the community, by tech, we won in third place, that give us the potential to build an Start-Up and 
            receive the city hall and the Emprel as Sponsors for our project, and toghether we receive from an invite from 
            out college to incubate our Start-Up there, helping a lot in our start.
