            <h2>About me</h2>
            As I said, my name is Pedro. I`m an computer science graduate at UNICAP, I live in Brazil, 
            I started my gradutation in 2022 as soon as I could after I finished school. The only previous 
            knoledge I had about programming was a video that I saw to do an discord bot, and that is where 
            we begin.

                <h2>Discord bot</h2>
            </div>
            The discord bot I did using the replit, it was first IDE that I used in a moment where I did not even
            know about what was an IDE. I used Python to do it, his name is James Von James, after this, I did the 
            Austin Humble the Thrid Junior, and his sucessor and the last one, Kraken, even if he has the worse name 
            from all three, he was the better one, and did his music funcionalities pretty good!
